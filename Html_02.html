    <h3>Link Tag:</h3>
        <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>The "a" tag is called the link tag because the content of it has a link to someother page where it will redirect the user. 
    <p>This is a link to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/HTML/html_01.html">My First Document</a> Webpage.
       This is an another link to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp">"W3 Schools"</a> Webpage. <br>
       An attribute called "href" is required to be used inside the "a" start tag to mention the location/url of the link we need.</p>

    <p>The "img' tag is used to display any pictures from own system or available on the web. It has no end tag. <br> Attributes "src" defines the source of the picture. <br>"alt" is for any alternate text in case if the image fails to open. <br> "width" & "height" attributes are for defining the size of the picture. </p>
