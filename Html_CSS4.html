    <h1>Bodies of Water</h1>
    <p>There is an agitation in the Morgans’ swimming pool. The water becomes abruptly more aware, as if nudged from drowsing.</p>
    <p style="color: yellow;">The September sun is edging over the horizon. A flurry of crows crosses the brightening sky. Their squabbling rings out in the morning quiet of this Palm Springs suburb.</p>
    <div style="color: green;">The ripples in the pool abate quickly. There isn’t a breath of wind yet, and the pump remains off at this hour. The water lies inert, held down by gravity, walled in by layers of concrete. It appears tranquil but is not. It probes the rows of tile at the waterline. It investigates the grout that holds them in place. It presses against the pebbled coating that covers the bottom and sides of the basin. Its search for fissures is relentless. There are none to discover.</div>

<!-- When the CSS style is given in the HEAD and also in the BODY the one in the BODY will take the precedence first -->
