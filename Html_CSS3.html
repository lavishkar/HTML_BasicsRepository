    <p><h1><u>The Potatos</u></h1></p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The potatoes came out of the compost pile thick-limbed and determined, looking almost like tomatoes, given their height. You shook your head. “Once there are potatoes, there’s always potatoes.”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 20px; color: blue;">I liked the infinity of this. I thought Beget! The potatoes are begetting more potatoes! I thought of who would live in the little house after me, their wonder at the potatoes and the potatoes wondering at them. I liked the idea of this happening: someone happening upon a stock of potatoes behind their new home, the potatoes thriving amongst the begonias and spiderwort: a little secret. A stable, trustable thing. How fickle we must seem to the potatoes, how entitled to new perspectives and whims. Potatoes only want to stay.</p>

    <p style="border: 5px solid green;"> The potatoes could have come from anywhere. Admittedly, I am not someone who shops only at the farmers’ market. I am not someone who uses all of the food they buy. </p>

    <p style="border: 10px; border-style: dashed; border-color: aqua;">That’s why I started the compost pile: not to simply throw away the potatoes sprouting eyes but to compost. I had no idea those withered store-bought potatoes would actually grow. Imagine my surprise when they took off the way they did.</p>

    <p style="border: 5px solid red; padding: 20px;">It started so slowly. A leak in the basement. The dog’s ball rolling across the floor. I thought seismic shift. I thought this house does have strange, old bones. I did not think the potatoes. I did not think so many potatoes have begun to sprout beneath my home that the house’s very foundation has cracked and lifted. The potatoes began curling against the window, and through it.</p>

    <p style="border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px;">When you and I returned from our camping trip, the potatoes had begun to settle into my mattress. The power was off, the faucet running. They set up an aquaponic system; they had grown wise enough to water themselves. My bills were in the thousands. </p>
