        <p>The size H7 is the smallest of all the heading sizes while size H1 is the largest among them.</p>
        <p>When there is some big paragraph.

        <h4>The "br" Tag:</h4>
        <p>The <b>"br"</b> tag is for the line break and it doesn't have any end tag for it. And also the "b" tag is used to make the content bold.</p>

        <h4>The bold Tag:</h4>        
        <h4>This is a heading tag but the "b" tag doesn't work with it. But the "heading" itself is kind of bold letters only by default.</h4>
